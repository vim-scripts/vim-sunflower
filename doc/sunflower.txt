Depends on 'python'

SYNOPSIS                                                            *sunflower*

Sunflower is a plugin for adjusting Vim's |colorscheme| depending on the
time of day. It sets the day colorscheme for the daytime and the night
colorscheme for the night time.

INSTALLATION                                                *sunflower-install*

If you haven't installed the plugin files yet, please see the README for
instructions on the subject.

You will need python scripting support and the PyEphem library in order
to use this plugin. Also, auto-commands should be available. See the
README file that comes with the plugin package for instructions on how
to get these done.

By default, |sunflower| will install an autocommand to change the theme when
needed.  See |g:sunflower_install_autocommand| to learn how to modify this
behaviour.

Also, by default, |sunflower| will set the 'background' option to dark and
light depending on time, to enable or disable this behaviour, use the
|g:sunflower_set_background| variable.

CONFIGURATION                                                *sunflower-config*

There are 4 'variables' that one can use to configure how |sunflower| behaves,
and two of these are mandatory. The below descriptions of these variables
will use the latitude and longtitude for Istanbul.  Easiest way to find out
the longtitude of a city is to look it up in Wikipedia.

                                                              *g:sunflower_lat*

This variable should be set to the latitude of the current city, e.g. >

    let g:sunflower_lat=41
<
and is a mandatory variable, which means, if not set, |sunflower| will not
work.

                                                             *g:sunflower_long*

This variable should be set to the longtitude of the current city, e.g. >

    let g:sunflower_long=28
<
and is a mandatory variable, which means, if not set, |sunflower| will not
work.

                                                  *g:sunflower_colorscheme_day*

The name of the colorscheme to use for day.  Defaults to "default".

                                                *g:sunflower_colorscheme_night*

The name of the colorscheme to use for night.  Defaults to "default".

                                                          *SunflowerFindTheSun*

This function decides which colorscheme to use depending on the time of day.
It also sets the 'background' option aptly.

                                                   *g:sunflower_set_background*

This variable determines whether |sunflower| sets the 'background' option
depending on the time of day.  Defaults to 1 (enabled).  Set to 0 to disable.

                                              *g:sunflower_install_autocommand*

This variable determines whether sunflower installs an autocommand to
poll for channces to adjust the colorscheme. Defaults to 1 (enabled).
Set to 0 to disable.
